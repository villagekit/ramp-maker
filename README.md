# stepper-ramp ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰

Stepper motor acceleration ramp generator 

## install

with `npm`:

```shell
npm install @villagekit/stepper-ramp
```

## example

```js
const createRamp = require('@villagekit/stepper-ramp')

const ramp = createRamp({
  targetSpeedInStepsPerSec: 50,
  accelerationInStepsPerSecPerSec: 50,
})

const movement = ramp.movement(100)

const stepPeriodsInMicrosecs = Array.from(movement)

console.log(stepPeriodsInMicrosecs)
```

## api

### `createRamp = require('@villagekit/stepper-ramp')`

### `ramp = createRamp(options)`

`options` is an object with shape:

- `targetSpeedInStepsPerSec`: max speed in (steps / second)
- `accelerationInStepsPerSecPerSec`: acceleration in (steps / second^2)

### `stepPeriods = ramp.movement(steps)`

`steps` is a number.

`stepIterable` is an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterable_protocol) of step periods in microsecs. to convert the `Iterable` to an array, use [`Array.from`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from).
